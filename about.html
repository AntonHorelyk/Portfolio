        <p>I was born in Ukraine, in august 2002.
            <br>
            When I was 15 years old I decided to pack my bags and go to Israel.
            <br>
            When I came to Israel ,I start learn Hebrew and other subjects in the school.
            <br>
            After school I choose go to interesting projet that help to the tenagers like me to do something interesting
            before they are called up to the army.
            <br>
            In this program I had opportunity to lern more about Israel culture, about army and life in addult world.
            <br>
            This is was very interesting year,I lern alot about sea world, ships and sea sport. I lern how to sail at
            sea and how to cath a wave on a surfboard.
            <br>
            In 2021 I was drafted into the army as a NAVY solder, on not so big, but the best ship with number D818.
            <br>
            And now after 3 years of patrols in the Red Sea,I choose to start my way in IT world with alot of possibilities.
